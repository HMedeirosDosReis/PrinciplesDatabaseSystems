	Started final exam project, following the instructions that were given in the handout.
	I was able to make it compile for the first time with the mysql conections that were needed.
	For today I will work with the options number 1, 2, 4 and 5. Which are similar to the last project, so it might be easier.

	I only worked in option 3. It seems that I have some bugs related to weather I should allow this transation or not.
	Fixed the bug about when it should allow or not, it turns out I was using res1 instead of res in one of the if statments.
	I still need to handle situations where there is a recipe that none of the ingredients are in the Inventory table, making both 0 and sending the wrong message to the screen and commiting the transaction

	I was able to fix that  bug with the transactions.
