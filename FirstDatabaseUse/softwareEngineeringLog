	Started project 2, following the instructions that were given in the handout.
	I was able to make it compile for the first time with the mysql conections that were needed.
	For today I will look into project 1 and try to recicle some of the code, since both are very similar.

	I worked in the addition and the list the results part. I didnt see many bugs and the majority of them were corelated to mysql.
	I still need to work in how to not add duplicates, handle the delete, and transcript

	It looks like I have everything covered, all I need now is to test and make sure everything workds

	During testing I had some output bugs when trying to output, sometimes it is printing semesters that have not had any courses taken during them. 
	I was able to fix this bug, only an if statment did it.
